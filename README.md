# Installation of new clud server
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
Our company aimed to expand its cloud hosting services by deploying an additional four servers to enhance service delivery. This expansion required configuring the new servers and integrating them into our existing network infrastructure within the data center
<h2>My Role</h2>
As the technician assigned to this project, I was responsible for installing the operating system "Windows Server 2022" and configuring the IPMI "Intelligent Platform Management Interface" for efficient remote management and maintenance. Additionally, I configured the IP gateway, netmask, and DNS settings to ensure seamless network communication. To enable communication with the secondary cloud infrastructure, I also installed SFP modules.

Upon completing the initial configurations, I installed a Broadcom NIC "Network Interface Card" to ensure compatibility for communication with the secondary cloud infrastructure. I also made sure the necessary drivers were installed and verified functionality to ensure optimal performance
