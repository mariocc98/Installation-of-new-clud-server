# Installation of new clud sercver
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
Our company has decided to expand its cloud hosting business by deploying an additional four servers to enhance the delivery of cloud services to clients. This expansion includes configuring the servers and integrating them into the network infrastructure within the data center
<h2>My Role</h2>
As the technician involved in this project, I was responsible for installing the operating system, Windows Server, and configuring the IPMI "Intelligent Platform Management Interface" for efficient remote management and maintenance. Additionally, I configured the IP gateway, netmask, and DNS1 to ensure proper network communication. I also installed SFPmodules to enable communication with the secondary cloud infrastructure.

After completing all the installations and configurations, the final task was to install a different NIC "Network Interface Card". This was necessary because communication with the secondary cloud required matching NICs, and in this case, a Broadcom NIC was required for compatibility. I also ensured that the necessary drivers were installed to ensure proper functionality.
